# Profile Edit Auto-Fill - Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Previously, when clicking "Edit Profile" from the dashboard, all form fields were empty, requiring users to re-enter everything from scratch.

Now, **all fields are pre-filled with existing data** from the database, allowing users to only update the fields they want to change!

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Onboarding Step 1** (`packages/frontend/pages/onboarding/step1.js`)

**Added** `loadExistingUserData()` function that pre-fills:
- ✅ Occupation, Company, Designation
- ✅ Years of Experience, Education, Annual Income
- ✅ Date of Birth (from database)
- ✅ Gender (from database)
- ✅ Complete Address (street, city, state, pincode, country)

**How it works**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    loadExistingUserData();  // Load from database first
    checkVerificationStatus(); // Then apply verified field locks
  }
}, [user]);
```

**Smart Merging**:
1. First loads your saved data from database
2. Then locks fields that DIDIT verified
3. Keeps your manual data for unverified fields

### 2. **Onboarding Step 2** (`packages/frontend/pages/onboarding/step2.js`)

**Added** `useEffect` to pre-fill:
- ✅ Land Types (checkboxes)
- ✅ Preferred Locations (with add/remove functionality)
- ✅ Investment Goal
- ✅ Risk Appetite
- ✅ Investment Horizon
- ✅ Minimum/Maximum Investment Amount

**How it works**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && user.investmentPreferences) {
    // Load all saved investment preferences
    setFormData({
      landTypes: user.investmentPreferences.landTypes || [],
      preferredLocations: user.investmentPreferences.preferredLocations || [...],
      // ... all other fields
    });
  }
}, [user]);
```
