# DIDIT Direct Verification - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What Was Changed

The DIDIT integration has been **completely updated** from a session-based flow to a **direct document verification** approach. This is simpler, faster, and more user-friendly.

---

## 🔄 Flow Comparison

### OLD Flow (Session-based):
```
1. User clicks "Verify"
2. Backend creates session
3. Popup opens to DIDIT site
4. User enters data on DIDIT
5. Redirect back to callback
6. Webhook notification
7. Store results
```

### NEW Flow (Direct Upload):
```
1. User uploads ID document photo
2. Send to DIDIT API
3. Get results immediately
4. Auto-fill form
✅ Done!
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### Backend `.env` (Simplified!)

```env
# DIDIT Configuration - SIMPLIFIED!
DIDIT_BASE_URL=https://verification.didit.me

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "ENOTFOUND verification.didit.me"
**Solution**: Check your internet connection and DIDIT_BASE_URL

### Error: "Only image files are allowed"
**Solution**: Upload JPG/PNG files only

### Error: "File size must be less than 10MB"
**Solution**: Compress your image or take a new photo

### Error: "Document verification failed"
**Possible causes**:
1. Image is blurry
2. Document is cut off
3. Text is not readable
4. Invalid API key

**Solution**: Try with a clearer image

### Document Declined
**Reasons**:
1. Expired document
2. Poor image quality
3. Document not recognized
4. Text extraction failed

**Solution**: Use a valid, clear document image
