## 📋 What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Documentation & Environment Setup ✅

**Files Created:**
- `DIDIT_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration guide with setup instructions

**Environment Variables Required:**
```env
# Backend (.env)
DIDIT_API_KEY=your_didit_api_key_here
DIDIT_API_SECRET=your_didit_api_secret_here
DIDIT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
DIDIT_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
DIDIT_BASE_URL=https://sandbox-api.didit.me
DIDIT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1/didit/callback

# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DIDIT_ENABLED=true
```

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation ✅

#### 1. **User Model Updates**
**File:** `packages/backend/src/models/User.model.js`

Added DIDIT verification fields:
- `diditVerification` object with complete verification tracking
- `isVerified`, `verifiedAt`, `aadhaarVerified`, `ageVerified`, `addressVerified`
- `verificationData` with encrypted storage
- Verified name, DOB, address, age, gender
- Verification proof/token storage

#### 2. **DIDIT Service Layer**
**File:** `packages/backend/src/services/didit.service.js`

Complete DIDIT API integration:
- `initializeVerification()` - Start verification flow
- `handleCallback()` - Process OAuth callback
- `getVerificationStatus()` - Check user verification status
- `storeVerifiedData()` - Securely store verified data
- `validateWebhook()` - Validate webhook signatures
- `processWebhook()` - Handle verification events
- Data encryption for Aadhaar (last 4 digits only)
- Audit logging for all verification attempts

#### 3. **DIDIT Controller**
**File:** `packages/backend/src/controllers/didit.controller.js`

API endpoints implementation:
- `initiateVerification` - POST /api/v1/didit/initiate
- `handleCallback` - GET /api/v1/didit/callback
- `getVerificationStatus` - GET /api/v1/didit/status
- `webhookHandler` - POST /api/v1/didit/webhook

#### 4. **DIDIT Routes**
**File:** `packages/backend/src/routes/didit.routes.js`

- Registered all DIDIT endpoints
- Applied authentication middleware where needed
- Public endpoints for callbacks and webhooks

#### 5. **Server Configuration**
**File:** `packages/backend/src/server.js`

- Imported DIDIT routes
- Registered routes at `/api/v1/didit`

#### 6. **Updated Onboarding Controller**
**File:** `packages/backend/src/controllers/user.controller.js`

- Modified `updateOnboardingStep1` to handle DIDIT-verified data
- Auto-uses verified DOB and address when available
- Prevents manual override of verified fields

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation ✅

#### 1. **API Client Updates**
**File:** `packages/frontend/lib/api.js`

Added DIDIT API methods:
```javascript
