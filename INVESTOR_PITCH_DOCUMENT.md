# CoSpaces: Fractional Land Investment Platform
## Executive Summary & Investment Proposal

---

## 1. Business Model Overview

### Company Mission
CoSpaces is a technology-enabled platform that democratizes real estate investment by enabling fractional ownership of land assets through legally-structured Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). We bridge the gap between high-value land assets and retail investors, making real estate investment accessible, transparent, and compliant.

### How It Works
1. **Land Acquisition**: Platform identifies and vets land investment opportunities across India
2. **SPV Formation**: Each land asset is held in a separate Private Limited Company (SPV) with proper incorporation
3. **Fractional Investment**: Investors pool funds to acquire land through the SPV, receiving equity shares proportional to their investment
4. **Equity Distribution**: Automated share allocation based on investment amount (minimum investment: configurable per project)
5. **Value Realization**: Returns generated through land appreciation, sale, or rental income, distributed pro-rata to shareholders
6. **Exit Strategy**: Investors can exit through SPV liquidation upon land sale or secondary market transactions

### Revenue Model
- **Platform Fees**: 2-3% of total investment amount per project
- **Management Fees**: 1-2% annual fee on asset value (for ongoing management)
- **Transaction Fees**: Small fee on distributions and exits
- **Escrow Services**: Interest on escrow accounts during fundraising period

### Market Opportunity
- **Indian Real Estate Market**: ₹15+ lakh crores, growing at 9-10% CAGR
- **Fractional Ownership Trend**: Emerging asset class with increasing investor interest
- **Target Segment**: Retail investors (₹50K - ₹50L investment capacity), HNIs, and institutional investors
- **Geographic Focus**: Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities with high growth potential
