# CoSpaces: Fractional Land Investment Platform
## Short Pitch

---

## The Opportunity

**CoSpaces** democratizes real estate investment by enabling fractional ownership of land assets through legally-structured Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). We make high-value land investments accessible to retail investors who previously couldn't afford entire properties.

---

## The Problem We Solve

- **High Entry Barriers**: Traditional land investment requires ₹50L-₹5Cr+ capital
- **Liquidity Issues**: Real estate is illiquid, locking capital for years
- **Compliance Complexity**: Regulatory requirements (Companies Act, SEBI, RERA, PMLA) are complex
- **Lack of Transparency**: Investors have limited visibility into asset performance

---

## Our Solution

**Technology-Enabled Fractional Ownership Platform**

1. **Identify & Acquire**: We source and vet land investment opportunities across India
2. **SPV Structure**: Each land asset is held in a separate Private Limited Company (SPV)
3. **Fractional Investment**: Investors pool funds (minimum ₹50K) to acquire land, receiving equity shares
4. **Automated Compliance**: Built-in regulatory compliance (KYC/AML, private placement limits, RERA checks)
5. **Value Realization**: Returns through land appreciation, sale, or rental income - distributed pro-rata
6. **Transparent Reporting**: Real-time portfolio tracking and automated distribution statements

---

## Business Model

- **Platform Fees**: 2-3% of total investment per project
- **Management Fees**: 1-2% annual fee on asset value
- **Transaction Fees**: Small fees on distributions and exits

**Market Size**: ₹15+ lakh crores Indian real estate market, growing at 9-10% CAGR
